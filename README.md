# MGTCNï¼šMulti-omics Graph Transformer Convolutional Network
Our study proposes a novel approach, MGTCN, for diagnosing DST tumor types and addressing the challenges associated
with early/late-stage tumor diagnosis. MGTCN leverages Graph
Topology Learning (GTL) to explore potential connections between
samples in multiple-omics similarity networks and performs omicsspecific learning using GCN. In contrast to other techniques, GCN
leverages both the omics characteristics and the correlation between samples depicted by similarity networks, culminating in outstanding classificatory efficiency. Moreover, MGTCN assimilates the
View Correlation Discovery Network (VCDN) [31] to scrutinize
the inter-omics correlation of extracted omics features through
GCN, thus promoting efficient integration of multi-omics data. Our
results demonstrate the practicality and strong multifunctionality of
MGTCN for tumor type and early/late-stage diagnosis in DST. We
also draw attention to the significance of amalgamating various sorts
of omics data and the paramountcy of coupling GCN and VCDN
for classifying multi-omics data, as corroborated by our investigation on divergent omics ablations. Furthermore, our study verifies
that MGTCN can identify significant omics features and biomarkers
related to biomedical research problems.
